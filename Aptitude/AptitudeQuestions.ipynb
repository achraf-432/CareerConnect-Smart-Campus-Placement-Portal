Clearly, the cubes shown in figures (1) and (4) cannot be formed since they have the half-shaded face adjacent to the face bearing the rhombus. Also, though the cube shown in fig. (3) has faces that can appear adjacent to each other but the cube formed by folding the sheet in fig. (X) cannot be rotated to form fig. (3). Hence, the cube in fig. (3) cannot be formed.
